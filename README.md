# Namaste🙏
I'm an AI guy(wait !! don't cringe ,i actually am), generative AI, NLP, and transformer-based models are my thing(yeah i can explain you the attention paper). My work revolves around exploring the latest techniques in machine learning and deep learning to push the boundaries of what's possible in technology(this was hyperbole , wasn't it?).

## What I Do
- **Research on Vulnerabilities of LLM Integrated Systems:** Research on RAG Systems.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Designing systems for language understanding, sentiment analysis, and conversational agents.
- **Transformer Models:** Experimenting with and fine-tuning state-of-the-art transformer architectures for various AI applications.
- **Research & Development:** Continuously exploring emerging trends and applying novel ideas to solve real-world problems.
