# Namasteüôè
I'm an AI guy, generative AI, NLP, and transformer-based models are my thing. My work revolves around exploring the latest techniques in machine learning and deep learning to push the boundaries of what's possible in technology.

## What I Do
- **Research on Vulnerabilities of LLM Integrated Systems:** Research on RAG Systems.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Designing systems for language understanding, sentiment analysis, and conversational agents.
- **Transformer Models:** Experimenting with and fine-tuning state-of-the-art transformer architectures for various AI applications.
- **Research & Development:** Continuously exploring emerging trends and applying novel ideas to solve real-world problems.

## Projects
